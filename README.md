# Flower Sphere

### To see a World in a Grain of Sand,
### And a Heaven in a Wild Flower,
### Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand,
### And Eternity in an hour.


## An interactive flower generator written in JavaScipt

### Based on L-system, recursion and rose curves
### Inspired by Holger Lippmann and Diana Lange
### Built as a part of a handmade florilegium by Willa Hua
#### More documentations coming soon on www.willahua.com
