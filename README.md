# Imagine a flower
### An interactive flower generator written in JavaScipt

To see a World in a Grain of Sand,
And a Heaven in a Wild Flower,
Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand,
And Eternity in an hour.


#### Based on L-system, recursion and rose curves
#### Inspired by Holger Lippmann and Diana Lange
#### Built as a part of a handmade florilegium by Willa Hua
